# MetaMap with UMLS data model for Portuguese

## This project and documentation are still under development.

This work intends to generate a data model in Portuguese using **MetaMap DFB 2022** and **UMLS-2022AB**. Once generated, a set of phrases related to pharmacovigilance from Twitter will be passed. It is intended to verify the amount of mapped biomedical terms and their assertiveness.

Installation and usage details can be found in the document [Installation MetaMap DFB2022](doc/Installation%MetaMap%DFB2022.pdf).
